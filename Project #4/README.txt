##Project Summary:
This project involves completing and understanding a TensorFlow tutorial on basic image classification. 
The tutorial uses the Fashion MNIST dataset to classify images of clothing into different categories. 
Expected to run the tutorial code, modify it according to specific tasks, and demonstrate an understanding by creating a short video presentation.

##Project Goals:
-Learn to implement and modify a neural network for image classification using TensorFlow and Keras.
-Gain experience with handling image data and visualizing both images and the results of the model predictions.
-Develop skills in explaining and demonstrating code functionality and modifications through a video presentation.

##Project #4 Directory Outline:
-project4.py: mainly from tensorflow website.

##Expected Inputs:
-Fashion MNIST dataset - provided by TensorFlow

##Libraries Used:
-tensorflow: creating and training machine learning models - neural networks.
-numpy: numerical operations.
-matplotlib.pylab: plotting graphs.

##Machine Learning Techniques Used:
-Neural Networks
-Softmax Layers

##Graphs Plotted:
-Visualizations of different training data photos and their classifications.
